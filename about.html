<p>I'm Shaked&nbsp; A certified CVT Vocal coach, musician, and your future guide in the world of singing. Want to find your unique voice and reach your musical goals? You're in the right place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My musical education began with an honors graduation from the arts and sciences high school of Modiin in the music department. Since then, I've become the lead vocalist, guitar player, lyricist, producer and composer in "Shaked Sanity," gaining broad stage and recording studios experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to vocal coaching, my background in music education and expertise in guitar playing equip me with a deep understanding of music theory. This isn't just about hitting the right notes; it's about understanding the language of music. When you work with me, you'll gain the kind of musical literacy that makes collaboration with other musicians a breeze. Whether you're jamming in a garage or recording in a studio, knowing the theory behind the sound will elevate your singing and your musicianship to new heights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But what I find most rewarding is sharing my knowledge and passion for singing with others. That's why I'm involved in CVT research for future technique development and why I offer personalized singing lessons tailored to your unique voice. Whether you're a beginner looking to find your voice or an experienced singer aiming to refine your technique, I'm here to help you reach your musical goals.</p>
					  <p>&nbsp;Ready to sing your heart out? Book a lesson with me today, and let's embark on this exciting vocal adventure together! </p>
